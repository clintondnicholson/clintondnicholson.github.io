# Summary
Bloc Jams is an online music player similar to Spotify made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and jQuery. This was the first project that I built.
# Explanation
All coders have to start somewhere. BlocJams was my first project ever. With the help of Bloc guiding me,
I was able to build this online music player. Initially everything was static HTML and CSS, but through
this project I was able to learn Javascript and jQuery and make things more dynamic.
# Problem
Going into this project, I did not know how to write Javascript or jQuery. Thats a problem when this project required that I be able to write certain functions would make things that would hold songs, make a seek bar functional, make a volume slider bar that adjusted the volume when you slid it one way or another, make next and previous song buttons that when you hit them went to the song before or after the song that was currently playing, make a play pause button that played the selected music when you played and stopped when you pressed stop. These all seem like very basic and easy functions of a music player but I had no idea hard difficult the code would be to write it.
# Solution
By using the tutorials from Bloc and with help from my mentor, the Bloc Community, and resources around the internet I was able to create the basic music player that performed how it was supposed to. Figuring out how to debug certain blocks of code was a great challenge, but ultimately helped me understand the process of debugging and beginning to think like a web developer should.
